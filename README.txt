This project is called  "Open Class Room assignments because I took a course about git and gitHub on open classRoom and I was asked to make this project and am on it!. :)
UPDATE: I just finished my project now and am about to submit, I think it took me 20 -25min to finish; but it was interesting and fun!
I have also corrected my mistakes like where I mis-spelled a word or deleted a file I wasn't suppose to create in the first place as far as this project is concerned; which means am gonna have more than 4 commits to this project - I was asked to only make 4 commits but I went above that - It's a mistake and am sorry. 
Thanks
